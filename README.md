# WDV339 Spotify Search Application

## Project Overview

This is my Full Sail Project and Portfolio III Project that leverages the Spotify API for searching artists, tracks, and songs. The application uses JSON Web Tokens and OAuth 2.0 for authenticating users and granting access to the application.

**Base Project Features & Functionality includes:**

- User authentication using OAuth 2.0
- Express API using Axios
- Sequelize ORM DB layer
- Vite React Frontend using TypeScript
- Spotify API usage to include a general search for
  - Artists
  - Tracks
  - Songs

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS V18.18 (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.18.0)
- [Express V4.18](https://expressjs.com/en/changelog/4x.html)
- [Axios V1.5.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Vite V4.5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite?activeTab=versions)
- [TypeScript V5.0](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-0.html)

## Getting Started

I have created some scripts to facilitate ease of setup and use of the application. To get started, from the root directory, run

`npm start`

This will install the application (Vite frontend and Express Backend), build the react application (React), and start the servers.
